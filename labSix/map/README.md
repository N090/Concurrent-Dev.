## Examples of Map Pattern  
The simplest pattern is a map. It is incredibly parallel and doesn't require data sharing amongst threads.  
Here are two examples with code that demonstrates how to obtain timing results that show acceleration.  

## SAXPY    
This is a common algorithm that's frequently applied in simulation. It represents Single-precision y := alpha * x + y, where x and y are n-vectors and alpha is a scalar. Combining scalar multiplication and vector addition, SAXPY is a very basic function that accepts a scalar value A as well as two vectors of 32-bit floats with N elements each, X and Y, as input. Every element X[i] is multiplied by A, and the product is added to Y[i]. Additionally, there are versions of the Double and Complex data types (DAxpy, Caxpy, and Zaxpy).

## Mandelbroit Set
The Mandelbrot set is a relatively simple two-dimensional set that shows a significant deal of intricacy, especially when enlarged. It is well-liked for both its fractal structures and visual attractiveness. The set is defined on the complex plane as the complex numbers c c for which the sequence f_{c}(0)}, f_{c}(f_{c}(0))}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value, and for which the function f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at z = 0 z=0.

Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski first defined and drew this set in 1978 as a part of their research on Kleinian groups.[3] Later, when Benoit Mandelbrot was employed at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Centre in Yorktown Heights, New York, in 1980, he was able to obtain excellent visualisations of the set. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
