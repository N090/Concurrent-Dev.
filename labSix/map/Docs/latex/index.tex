The simplest pattern is a map. It is incredibly parallel and doesn\textquotesingle{}t require data sharing amongst threads. ~\newline
 Here are two examples with code that demonstrates how to obtain timing results that show acceleration. ~\newline

This is a common algorithm that\textquotesingle{}s frequently applied in simulation. It represents Single-\/precision y \+:= alpha \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} x + y, where x and y are n-\/vectors and alpha is a scalar. Combining scalar multiplication and vector addition, SAXPY is a very basic function that accepts a scalar value A as well as two vectors of 32-\/bit floats with N elements each, X and Y, as input. Every element X\mbox{[}i\mbox{]} is multiplied by A, and the product is added to Y\mbox{[}i\mbox{]}. Additionally, there are versions of the Double and Complex data types (DAxpy, Caxpy, and Zaxpy).\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Mandelbroit Set}{Mandelbroit Set}}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
The Mandelbrot set is a relatively simple two-\/dimensional set that shows a significant deal of intricacy, especially when enlarged. It is well-\/liked for both its fractal structures and visual attractiveness. The set is defined on the complex plane as the complex numbers c c for which the sequence f\+\_\+\{c\}(0)\}, f\+\_\+\{c\}(f\+\_\+\{c\}(0))\}, etc., remains bounded in absolute value, and for which the function f\+\_\+\{c\}(z)=z\texorpdfstring{$^\wedge$}{\string^}\{2\}+c does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at z = 0 z=0.

Robert W. Brooks and Peter Matelski first defined and drew this set in 1978 as a part of their research on Kleinian groups.\mbox{[}3\mbox{]} Later, when Benoit Mandelbrot was employed at IBM\textquotesingle{}s Thomas J. Watson Research Centre in Yorktown Heights, New York, in 1980, he was able to obtain excellent visualisations of the set. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set}{\texttt{ wiki}}
